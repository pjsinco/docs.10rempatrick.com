Here are some common markup patterns you'll be using.

###Paragraphs
The ```<p>``` element represents a paragraph of text.

```html
<p>"I asked them, 'How soon after getting to the moon did you feel like you got your sea legs back?' " he says. "They said that actually, they felt that they were stable pretty quickly. It was the center of gravity in the spacesuit that they wore on the surface that made them feel wobbly."</p>

```
###Links
The ```<a>``` element defines a hyperlink. 

Note: Commas, periods and other punctuation are not included in the linked text.

```html
<a href=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/slsd/about/divisions/spacemed/education/amc.html" title="Aerospace Medicine Clerkship">aerospace medicine</a>, 
```


###Inline styles
Mark italic text with the ```<em>``` tag.

```html
Then one day, he saw an ad for an aerospace medicine fellowship in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>.
```

Use the ```<strong>``` element for bold text.
```html
This is <strong>bold text<strong>.

```



###Subheads
Subheads within a story are marked up with the ```<h2>``` element, which represents a level-2 headline.

```html
<h2>Training and rehab</h2>
```


###Lists
The ```<ul>``` element defines an unordered list, which is one without numerical ordering. 

The ```<ol>``` element is used for ordered lists--those with numerical ordering.

Each item in a list is defined by the ```<li>``` element.

```html
<ul>
  <li>Know your patients.</li> 
  <li>Don't expect everyone to teach you and teach you well.</li> 
  <li>Be proactive.</li>
  <li>Be willing to learn.</li> 
  <li>Keep studying for second-level exams&mdash;they aren't as scary as first-level exams.</li> 
</ul>
```
