###Pull quotes
The ```style``` attribute is optional; Defaults to "left."

```[pullquote style="<left|full>" quote="<quote>"]```

```php
[pullquote quote="I love being a doctor, but I also love doing other things."]

[pullquote style="full" quote="I love being a doctor, but I also love doing other things."]

[pullquote style="left" quote="I love being a doctor, but I also love doing other things."]
```

###Advertisements
**Place two ads into every story&mdash;one for Don, one for Peggy.**

On small and medium screens, a medium-rectangle ad will appear where you set the shortcode.

```[advertisement id="<don|peggy>"]```

```php
[advertisement id="peggy"]
```
