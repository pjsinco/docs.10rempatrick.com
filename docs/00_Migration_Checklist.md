Follow these steps for each story during migration. 

1. **Read the story.** You'll be making several decisions about this article, so give yourself a good foundation. Start thinking about a kicker. Take note of pull quotes and images. 

  Click the link to the original story. The link is at the bottom of each post's edit page. 

2. **Select the featured image,** if the story has one. This is the image that will appear at the very top of the story.

3. **Set the featured image caption** and other information. The images do not yet have captions. 

  In the Media Libary, select the featured image.  Then, using the original story as your basis, fill in the following: 

    * *Caption.* The caption may need shortening. A good length is a tweet, but you have some wiggle room. Try to stay under 170 characters, not including the image credit.

    * *Alternative Text.* This is a [short description](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/114016?hl=en) of the image.

    * *Description*. Optional. This is the short, 2-to-4-word label that will appear under the featured image. A good label is often simply the name of the pictured physician. 

4. **Choose a category.** Each story will be assigned to one category. After you select the category, be sure to uncheck the default "Uncategorized."

5. **Pick spots for Don and Peggy.** For every story, we'll be including placeholders for two ads. On small- and medium-size screens, these ads will appear where you place them in the story. 
    * Watch how they mingle with other story elements, like pull quotes and images. No element should appear too close to another. 

    * The ads should appear toward the top of the story. Don might work well after the 3rd graf. Try Peggy 3 grafs below that.

    * We set these placeholders with the shortcode ```[advertisement]```

6. **Add the remaining article elements.** These steps can be done in any order. 

    * *Add any sidebars.* If the story has a sidebar, create a new Story Sidebar. Copy the ID of the sidebar, and place the sidebar in the story with the ```[story-sidebar]``` shortcode.

        * Note: If the sidebar is a compilation of articles, skip this step. We'll add these article groupings dynamically. 


    * *Add in-article images.* 
        * You add these using the ```[story-image]``` shortcode.

    * *Checkpoint: How are things looking?* Narrow your browser window. Is the page looking good? Alright! Move on. Otherwise, try moving some elements around.

    * *Add pull quotes.* Try to keep these to the length of a tweet--140 characters. 

        * Note: Pull quotes do not appear on small screens.

        * You don't need to use every pull quote that appears in the original article.

7. **Add the kicker.** By now you've thought of a good one.

8. **Add the tags.**

9. **Add other meta data as needed.** If the story is part of a series, note it in the "Series" field. In the "Schools" field, capture any COMs that are notable in the story. 

10. **Add the author info,** if needed. This includes a bio and a photo.

11. **Finished? Mark the status as 'Pending Review'**.
